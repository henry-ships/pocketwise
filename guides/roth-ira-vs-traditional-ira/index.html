    <h1>Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA: Which One Should You Choose?</h1>

    <h2>The Core Difference: When You Pay the Tax</h2>

<p>Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA is really one question dressed up in a lot of jargon: would you rather pay taxes on your retirement money <em>now</em>, or <em>later</em>? Everything else — the contribution limits, the rules, the strategy — flows from that single distinction.</p>

<p>With a <strong>Traditional IRA</strong>, you contribute pre-tax or tax-deductible dollars today, the money grows without being taxed along the way, and you pay ordinary income tax when you withdraw in retirement. The government lets you delay the tax bill, but it will eventually collect.</p>

<p>With a <strong>Roth IRA</strong>, you contribute money you've already paid income tax on, it grows completely tax-free, and qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free too. You pay the tax upfront, but you're done with the IRS on that money forever.</p>

<p>Neither is universally better. The right choice depends on where you sit tax-wise today versus where you expect to land in retirement — and that's a calculation worth doing carefully, because the difference can add up to tens of thousands of dollars over a 30-year investing horizon.</p>

<p>For 2026, the annual IRA contribution limit is <strong>$7,000</strong> ($8,000 if you're 50 or older). Both account types share this combined limit — you can split contributions between the two, but the total can't exceed $7,000.</p>

<h2>Traditional IRA: How It Actually Works</h2>

<p>A Traditional IRA gives you a potential tax deduction today. Whether you actually get the deduction depends on two factors: whether you (or your spouse) have access to a workplace retirement plan, and what your income is.</p>

<h3>Deductibility Rules for 2026</h3>

<p>If neither you nor your spouse has access to a 401(k) or similar workplace plan, you can deduct 100% of your Traditional IRA contribution regardless of income. No income limit applies.</p>

<p>If you <em>do</em> have access to a workplace plan, the deduction phases out at higher incomes:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Filing Status</th>
      <th>Phase-Out Starts</th>
      <th>Phase-Out Ends</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Single / Head of Household</td>
      <td>~$79,000</td>
      <td>~$89,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Married Filing Jointly (covered spouse)</td>
      <td>~$126,000</td>
      <td>~$146,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Married Filing Jointly (non-covered spouse)</td>
      <td>~$236,000</td>
      <td>~$246,000</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Above the upper threshold, you can still contribute to a Traditional IRA — you just won't get a deduction. A non-deductible Traditional IRA contribution still grows tax-deferred, but it complicates your withdrawal taxes later (you'll need to track your basis). This is also the setup that enables the "backdoor Roth" strategy, which we'll cover below.</p>

<h3>Withdrawal Rules</h3>

<p>You can start taking money out penalty-free at age 59½. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income — whatever tax bracket you're in at the time determines what you pay. At age 73, <strong>required minimum distributions (RMDs)</strong> kick in, forcing you to withdraw a minimum amount each year whether you want to or not. This is a meaningful constraint for people who don't need the income and would prefer to keep the money growing.</p>

<p>Early withdrawals (before 59½) trigger a 10% penalty on top of ordinary income tax, with a handful of exceptions: first-time home purchase (up to $10,000 lifetime), qualified higher education expenses, health insurance premiums if unemployed, and a few others listed by the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/individual-retirement-arrangements-iras" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IRS in their IRA guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>Roth IRA: How It Actually Works</h2>

<p>A Roth IRA is the account where you pay taxes now and walk away tax-free later. The appeal is straightforward: 30 years of compound growth, completely shielded from future tax increases or bracket creep. What you see is what you get.</p>

<h3>Income Limits for 2026</h3>

<p>Roth IRAs have income limits — above a certain threshold, your ability to contribute phases out and eventually disappears:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Filing Status</th>
      <th>Phase-Out Starts</th>
      <th>Phase-Out Ends (No Contribution)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Single / Head of Household</td>
      <td>~$150,000</td>
      <td>~$165,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Married Filing Jointly</td>
      <td>~$236,000</td>
      <td>~$246,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Married Filing Separately</td>
      <td>$0</td>
      <td>$10,000</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If your income exceeds the upper limit, you can't contribute directly to a Roth IRA. But you can still access Roth benefits through the backdoor Roth conversion strategy — more on that in a moment.</p>

<h3>Withdrawal Rules</h3>

<p>This is where the Roth really shines. Your <strong>contributions</strong> (not earnings) can be withdrawn at any time, at any age, with no tax and no penalty. This makes a Roth IRA more flexible than a Traditional IRA as a savings vehicle — it's not perfect as an emergency fund (don't raid your retirement savings), but the access is there.</p>

<p>Earnings can be withdrawn tax-free and penalty-free after age 59½, as long as the account has been open for at least five years. There are no required minimum distributions during the account owner's lifetime — a major advantage for people who want to let money compound as long as possible, or who want to pass the account to heirs.</p>

<h2>The Core Decision Framework: Which One Is Right for You?</h2>

<p>The single most important variable is your expected tax rate: lower now than in retirement means Roth wins. Higher now than in retirement means Traditional wins. But "expected tax rate in retirement" is genuinely hard to predict, so here's a practical decision framework based on your situation today.</p>

<h3>Strong Case for Roth IRA</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>You're early in your career.</strong> Your income — and therefore your tax rate — is probably at or near its lifetime low. Paying tax on $7,000 at a 22% rate now, then never paying tax on the growth, is a very good deal if that money compounds for 30+ years.</li>
  <li><strong>You expect your income to grow significantly.</strong> Engineers, medical residents, lawyers early in their careers, entrepreneurs — if your income will likely be substantially higher in 10-15 years, locking in today's lower rate makes sense.</li>
  <li><strong>You want flexibility.</strong> The ability to withdraw contributions without penalty, and no RMD requirements, gives Roth accounts a flexibility edge that's worth something even if the tax math is close.</li>
  <li><strong>You want tax diversification in retirement.</strong> Having both Roth and Traditional accounts gives you control over your taxable income in retirement — you can pull from the Roth in high-income years to stay in a lower bracket.</li>
  <li><strong>You believe tax rates will be higher in the future.</strong> This is speculative, but not unreasonable given federal debt levels. If marginal rates rise, Roth accounts become even more valuable.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Strong Case for Traditional IRA</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>You're in a high tax bracket now.</strong> If you're in the 32%, 35%, or 37% bracket today and expect to be in the 22% or 24% bracket in retirement (because you'll be living on less), the Traditional deduction is genuinely valuable.</li>
  <li><strong>You need the tax break today.</strong> The Traditional IRA deduction reduces your taxable income this year, which means a lower tax bill right now. For someone who is cash-constrained but can scrape together $7,000 to invest, getting $1,540 back from the IRS (at 22% rate) is real money.</li>
  <li><strong>You're close to retirement.</strong> If you have 5-10 years until retirement and expect to be in a lower bracket once you stop working, the Traditional deduction today and lower withdrawal taxes later is likely the right call.</li>
  <li><strong>You have high state income taxes.</strong> In states with income taxes of 8-13%, the Traditional deduction is worth considerably more than the headline federal rate suggests. Calculate your <em>combined</em> marginal rate.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The "Do Both" Answer</h3>

<p>Many people don't have to choose just one. If you're within the Roth IRA income limits, you can split your $7,000 between both accounts — say, $3,500 in each — and build tax diversification from the start. Tax diversification means you'll have flexibility in retirement to manage your taxable income by pulling from whichever account type is strategically better in any given year.</p>

<p>Run both scenarios side by side with the <a href="https://pocketwise.io/pretax-vs-roth/">PocketWise Pre-Tax vs. Roth calculator</a>. It models both paths using your current and estimated retirement tax rates and shows you the actual after-tax dollar difference. In close cases, the numbers are often closer than people expect — and tax diversification becomes the dominant strategy.</p>

<h2>The 401(k) Comes First — Here's Why</h2>

<p>Before you fund either type of IRA, check whether your employer offers a 401(k) with a match. A 401(k) match is a 50-100% guaranteed return on your contribution — nothing in either IRA comes close to that.</p>

<p>The sequence most financial advisors recommend:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Contribute to your 401(k) up to the full employer match (this is free money — take all of it)</li>
  <li>Fund your IRA (Roth or Traditional based on the framework above) up to the $7,000 limit</li>
  <li>Return to your 401(k) if you have more to invest beyond the IRA limit</li>
</ol>

<p>If you're not sure whether you're leaving employer match money on the table, the <a href="https://pocketwise.io/401k-match-optimizer/">401(k) Match Optimizer</a> calculates the exact contribution needed to capture your full match — and shows you what you're giving up by contributing less. Most people are surprised by how much match they're leaving uncollected.</p>

<p>Curious how a higher 401(k) contribution will affect your actual take-home pay? The <a href="https://pocketwise.io/401k-paycheck-impact/">401(k) Paycheck Impact tool</a> shows the exact dollar change to your paycheck — because the cost to contribute is lower than it looks once you factor in the tax savings.</p>

<h2>The Backdoor Roth: What It Is and When to Use It</h2>

<p>If your income exceeds the Roth IRA limit (~$165,000 single, ~$246,000 married), you're not automatically locked out of Roth benefits. The backdoor Roth is a legal, IRS-acknowledged strategy that gets you there in two steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Contribute to a Traditional IRA (non-deductible, since you're likely covered by a workplace plan at this income level)</li>
  <li>Convert that Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA</li>
</ol>

<p>Because you've already paid taxes on the contribution (it was non-deductible), the conversion is tax-free or nearly so. The money is now in a Roth account and will grow and be withdrawn tax-free.</p>

<p>There are a few important caveats:</p>

<p><strong>The Pro-Rata Rule.</strong> If you have other pre-tax money in Traditional IRAs (from prior years of deductible contributions), the IRS requires you to treat the conversion as coming proportionally from all your IRA money — not just the new non-deductible contribution. This can create an unexpected tax bill. If you have significant pre-tax Traditional IRA balances, consult a tax professional before executing a backdoor Roth.</p>

<p><strong>Do it early in the year.</strong> Converting in January gives the money a full year to grow tax-free in the Roth. Converting in December means you got only two weeks of benefit before year end.</p>

<p><strong>It requires clean record-keeping.</strong> File Form 8606 with your tax return each year you make a non-deductible contribution or Roth conversion. This establishes your tax basis so you don't get taxed twice on the same money.</p>

<h2>Contribution Limits and Deadlines You Need to Know</h2>

<p>The 2026 contribution limits apply to all your IRAs combined — Traditional and Roth together:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Age</th>
      <th>Annual Limit</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Under 50</td>
      <td>$7,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>50 and older (catch-up)</td>
      <td>$8,000</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The deadline to contribute for a given tax year is <strong>Tax Day of the following year</strong> — typically April 15. That means you have until April 15, 2027 to make your 2026 IRA contributions. This is a meaningful window that most people underuse. If you can't afford $7,000 in January, you have 15+ months to get there.</p>

<p>One practical note: make sure you designate which tax year your contribution applies to. Most IRA custodians let you choose, but the default is usually the current calendar year. Double-check before submitting.</p>

<h2>Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA: The Numbers in Practice</h2>

<p>Here's a concrete example to show how the math plays out over time. Assume a 35-year-old contributes $7,000 per year for 30 years into either a Roth or Traditional IRA, earning 7% annual growth. They're in the 24% bracket today and will be in the 22% bracket in retirement.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Scenario</th>
      <th>Account Balance at 65</th>
      <th>Tax Owed on Withdrawal</th>
      <th>Net After-Tax Value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Roth IRA (pay tax now at 24%)</td>
      <td>~$661,000</td>
      <td>$0</td>
      <td>~$661,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Traditional IRA (pay tax later at 22%)</td>
      <td>~$661,000</td>
      <td>~$145,000</td>
      <td>~$516,000</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>In this case, the Roth wins — paying 24% now is better than paying 22% later, because the tax savings from deferral don't overcome the difference. But flip the rates — 24% now, 12% in retirement — and the Traditional account pulls ahead. The math responds directly to the rate gap.</p>

<p>To see this calculated with your actual numbers, use the <a href="https://pocketwise.io/pretax-vs-roth/">Pre-Tax vs. Roth calculator</a>. Enter your current bracket, your expected retirement bracket, years to retirement, and annual contribution — it runs the full projection and shows you the net after-tax outcome for both paths.</p>

<p>And to see what the compounding looks like in isolation, the <a href="https://pocketwise.io/compound-interest-calculator/">compound interest calculator</a> shows how $7,000 per year grows at various return rates over 20, 30, or 40 years. The numbers are often motivating.</p>

<h2>Investment Fees Matter More Than Most People Realize</h2>

<p>One factor often overlooked in the Roth vs. Traditional debate: fund fees inside your IRA. A 1% annual expense ratio sounds small, but over 30 years it can reduce your final balance by 25-30%.</p>

<p>Both Roth and Traditional IRAs let you choose your own investments. Most brokerage platforms offer low-cost index funds with expense ratios under 0.10%. There's rarely a reason to pay more. The <a href="https://pocketwise.io/fee-drag-calculator/">fee drag calculator</a> shows the real cost of expense ratios on your specific balance and time horizon — it's a sobering look at what unnecessary fees actually cost.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

<p><strong>Contributing to the wrong account because of a headline.</strong> "Roth is always better" is a common oversimplification. It depends on your tax rates. Run the numbers.</p>

<p><strong>Leaving employer match uncollected.</strong> Funding an IRA before capturing your full 401(k) match is one of the most expensive sequencing mistakes in personal finance. Match first, IRA second.</p>

<p><strong>Missing the contribution deadline.</strong> You have until April 15 of the following year. If you're short on cash in December, you still have four months to make the prior year's contribution. Many people leave an entire year's contribution on the table by not knowing this.</p>

<p><strong>Treating an IRA as a savings account.</strong> Some people open an IRA, fund it, and let it sit in the money market default. The account is just a wrapper — you still need to invest the money inside it in actual funds or ETFs. An IRA with $7,000 sitting in a 0.01% default cash position is not working for you.</p>

<p><strong>Withdrawing early and triggering penalties.</strong> Both account types have early withdrawal penalties, though the Roth is more forgiving (contributions only, not earnings). Treat IRA money as genuinely untouchable until retirement. If you need accessible savings, that's what an emergency fund is for — not your IRA.</p>

<p><strong>Ignoring the spousal IRA option.</strong> If one spouse has little or no earned income, they can still contribute to an IRA based on the working spouse's income. A married couple where one spouse doesn't work can still contribute $14,000 total ($7,000 each) to separate IRAs. This is the spousal IRA rule and it's widely underused.</p>

<h2>FAQ — Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA</h2>

<p><strong>Can I have both a Roth IRA and a Traditional IRA at the same time?</strong><br>
Yes. You can contribute to both in the same year, as long as your combined contributions don't exceed the $7,000 annual limit (or $8,000 if 50+). Many people split their contributions between both for tax diversification.</p>

<p><strong>What happens if I contribute too much?</strong><br>
Over-contributions are subject to a 6% excise tax per year until you fix the error. You can withdraw the excess (plus earnings) before Tax Day without penalty. Most brokerage platforms will alert you to excess contributions, but don't rely on that.</p>

<p><strong>Can I convert my Traditional IRA to a Roth?</strong><br>
Yes, at any time, regardless of income. You'll pay ordinary income tax on any pre-tax money converted in the year of conversion. Converting in a low-income year (between jobs, early retirement, etc.) minimizes the tax hit.</p>

<p><strong>Should I stop contributing to my 401(k) to fund an IRA instead?</strong><br>
Not unless you've already captured your full employer match. The match is too valuable to pass up. After the match, the IRA often has better investment options and lower fees than many 401(k) plans — so it's worth prioritizing the IRA next.</p>

<p><strong>What if I'm self-employed?</strong><br>
Self-employed individuals have access to SEP-IRAs and Solo 401(k)s in addition to Traditional and Roth IRAs. Contribution limits are much higher — a Solo 401(k) allows up to $69,000 in 2026 for those under 50. These are worth exploring if you're self-employed with significant income.</p>

<p><strong>Does the type of IRA affect what I can invest in?</strong><br>
No. Both Roth and Traditional IRAs let you invest in stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, CDs, and most other securities. Some specialized IRAs (called self-directed IRAs) allow real estate and other alternative assets, but those come with significant complexity and risk. For most people, low-cost index funds inside either account type is the right approach.</p>
